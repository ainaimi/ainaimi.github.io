Welcome! I am Professor in the Department of Epidemiology at the [Rollins School of Public Health](https://www.sph.emory.edu/), Emory University.

My work focuses on developing and applying advanced quantitative methods to answer questions about analytic methodologies, data science, and public health. I enjoy teaching the next generation and collaborating with researchers across disciplines to advance our understanding of science, health, and disease.

## Research

My research integrates cutting-edge methods in **causal inference**, **machine learning**, and **artificial intelligence** to address complex questions in epidemiology. I am particularly interested in applying these methods to understand:

- Reproductive and perinatal health outcomes
- Nutritional epidemiology and dietary patterns
- Social determinants of health and health equity
- Methods for analyzing complex observational and randomized trial data

Through collaboration with researchers across the country, I work on projects ranging from pregnancy outcomes to chronic disease prevention. My methodological work focuses on addressing real-world challenges in study design, measurement error, effect transportability, and causal inference from observational data.

## Consulting

I provide statistical and methodological consulting for academic researchers, government agencies, and other organizations. My expertise includes:

- Study design and causal inference
- Machine learning applications in health research
- Analysis of complex longitudinal and observational data
- Grant proposal development

## Teaching

I teach courses in epidemiologic methods, data science, causal inference, and quantitative research at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. I am committed to making complex statistical concepts accessible and helping students develop practical skills they can apply in their research.
