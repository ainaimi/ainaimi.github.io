**I am currently building this site. Lots of changes to come ...**

I focus on causal inference, machine learning, and reproductive epidemiology at Emory University's [Rollins School of Public Health](https://www.sph.emory.edu/) in the Department of Epidemiology. 

A recent copy of my CV is available [here](files/CV.ain.Dec2020.pdf).

The Effects of Aspirin in Gestation and Reproduction (EAGeR) study was a randomized trial of low-dose aspirin to prevent miscarriage and promote live birth. Complex longitudinal data were collected in this trial, and we are currently using a range of methods to estimate per protocol effects, adjust for measurement error, and to transport the estimated per protocol effects to a more representative population.

The Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: Monitoring Mothers-to-Be (nuMoM2b) study was an observational cohort study of a range of factors affecting pregnancies of nulliparous women. [Dr Lisa Bodnar](https://publichealth.pitt.edu/home/directory/lisa-m-bodnar) and I are currently using machine learning and causal inference techniques to evaluate patterns in diet that maximize positive pregnancy outcomes.
