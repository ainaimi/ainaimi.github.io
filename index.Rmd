I am Associate Professor in the Department of Epidemiology at the [Rollins School of Public Health](https://www.sph.emory.edu/), Emory University. I have a PhD in Epidemiology and Biostatistics, with expertise in causal inference, machine learning, and artificial intelligence methods. Substantively, I leverage this expertise to answer questions related to reproductive and perinatal epidemiology, nutritional epidemiology, social determinants of health, and (recently) infectious diseases.

A recent copy of my CV is available [here](files/CV.ain.Jan2021.pdf).

### Compliance Adjustment in the Effects of Aspirin on Gestation and Reproduction (R01)

The Effects of Aspirin in Gestation and Reproduction (EAGeR) study was a randomized trial of low-dose aspirin to prevent miscarriage and promote live birth. Complex longitudinal data were collected in this trial, and we are currently using a range of methods to estimate per protocol effects, adjust for measurement error, and to transport the estimated per protocol effects to a more representative population.

The Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: Monitoring Mothers-to-Be (nuMoM2b) study was an observational cohort study of a range of factors affecting pregnancies of nulliparous women. [Dr Lisa Bodnar](https://publichealth.pitt.edu/home/directory/lisa-m-bodnar) and I are currently using machine learning and causal inference techniques to evaluate patterns in diet that maximize positive pregnancy outcomes.
