**Erin Rogers** is currently completing a PhD in Epidemiology at Emory University. Her research is currently focused on mediation for opioid use disorder during the perinatal period. She is currently using tools for emulating randomized trials with real-world pharmacoepidemiologic data to evaluate the effectiveness of buprenorphine versus methadone on the risk of overdose in pregnancy. She is a fellow of the Training in Advanced Analytics to End Drug Related Harms (TADA) training program.

**Mundayi Nlandu** completed an MPH in Epidemiology at Emory University. Her research focused on developing and deploying machine learning algorithms to evaluate the relative roles of basic demographic, clinical, and reproductive markers as predictors of stillbirth in a population of pregnant women in Norway. Her work focused particularly on the role of fetal to placental weight ratios as a marker of stillbirth in the Norway population. She is currently an ORISE Fellow at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
