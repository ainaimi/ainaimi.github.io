**Jackie Rudolph** I'm a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow in Epidemiology at Emory University. My research is focused on applying advanced causal inference methods to address challenges in reproductive, HIV/AIDS, and Environmental epidemiology. In these areas, I am currently working on methods for causal intervention analysis, competing events, simulation, and generalization (transportability).
